## Project Summary

The existing scenario in our office cafeteria is that, first we need to wait and stand in queues to buy coupons for the food and then we need to wait in queues to receive what we have ordered. The problem that occurs is not only that this whole process is very tedious but also it results in the wastage of the precious time of the employees that could have been invested into something productive.

We aim to design a web application that will enable all the employees to order whatever they want to eat while being at their desks. This in turn will bring a disciplined approach in the cafeteria to handle orders and their timely serving.

## Deliveables

1. Register and Login for Employees.
2. Online menu respective to each counter in the cafeteria.
3. Online ordering of food and generation of receipt for the reception of the order.
4. Order status updation by the counter/kitchen staff.
5. Updation of daily menu by the counter/kitchen staff.

## Affected Parties

The employees of the organization and the kitchen staff of each counter in the cafeteria.
